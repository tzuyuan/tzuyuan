<!-- I was a graduate student instructor (GSI) for ROB 530: Mobile Robotics. In this course, we cover theory and application of probabilistic techniques for autonomous mobile robotics. Topics include Bayesian filtering; stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles. -->
