Hello! I'm a [Robotics](https://robotics.umich.edu/) Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. Maani Ghaffari](https://name.engin.umich.edu/people/ghaffari-maani/). 

My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>machine learning</b> and <b>robot perception</b>. I'm particularly interested in exploring the <b>symmetry structure</b> of a system to develop efficient and generalizable robot algorithms. During my Ph.D., I have worked on robot state estimation, representation learning, and symmetry network design. Recently, I have a growing interest in dynamics modeling using neural networks.

Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I obtained my M.S. in [Robotics](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, where I did research on several visual odometry projects. Before that, I received my B.S. in [Mechanical Engineering](http://www.me.ntu.edu.tw/main.php?site_id=1) from National Taiwan University. 

If you find any of my work interesting, feel free to reach out to me at tzuyuan at umich dot edu. I'm happy to chat!

## News
* **[02/2024]** I gave a guest lecture in ROB 530: Mobile Robotics at the University of Michigan.
* **[11/2023]** I passed my thesis proposal!

## Robot I Have Worked with
I'm lucky enough to work with several different robots in the past!
